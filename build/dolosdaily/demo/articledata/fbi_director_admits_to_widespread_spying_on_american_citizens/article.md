In a shocking revelation, FBI Director Cameron Douglas has admitted that the intelligence agency has been spying on millions of American citizens without their knowledge or consent. The admission came during a congressional hearing yesterday where Douglas testified before the House Committee on Intelligence.

    According to Douglas, the FBI has been using advanced surveillance techniques to monitor the communications of citizens across the country. These techniques include monitoring phone calls, text messages, emails, and social media activity without a warrant or judicial oversight.

    When asked if these practices were widespread throughout the intelligence community, Douglas replied, "I'm afraid so. It has become routine for our agency to collect vast amounts of data on ordinary citizens who are not even suspected of a crime."

    This admission has raised serious concerns about the privacy rights of American citizens and the potential for abuse by intelligence agencies. Many lawmakers are calling for immediate reforms to protect civil liberties and ensure that these practices are brought to an end.

    "This is a blatant violation of our constitutional rights," said Senator Alex Ellis of California. "We cannot allow our government to continue invading the privacy of law-abiding citizens without proper oversight."

    In response to the growing backlash, the FBI released a statement claiming that their surveillance activities are necessary to protect national security and prevent future terrorist attacks. However, critics argue that these practices do little to improve security while severely eroding the privacy rights of American citizens.

    "We cannot allow our government to continue invading the privacy of law-abiding citizens without proper oversight."

    As the debate over surveillance practices continues, it remains unclear how these revelations will impact the upcoming presidential election and the future of civil liberties in the United States.
