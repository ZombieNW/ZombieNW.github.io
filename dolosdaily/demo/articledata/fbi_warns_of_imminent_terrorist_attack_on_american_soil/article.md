The FBI has issued a dire warning to all Americans, stating that an imminent terrorist attack on U.S. soil is "highly likely." The agency's director, Alexi Jenkins, made the announcement during a press conference earlier today, stating that intelligence gathered from various sources indicates that a large-scale attack is being planned by a previously unknown terrorist group.

    "We cannot provide specific details at this time for operational reasons," said Director Jenkins. "However, we can assure the American people that we are doing everything in our power to prevent this attack from occurring."

    The FBI has not yet identified the target or location of the planned attack, but they have asked citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to local law enforcement.

    "We urge all citizens to be aware of their surroundings and to report any unusual behavior they may observe," said Jenkins. "It is crucial that we work together to prevent this potential tragedy."

    The FBI's warning comes just days after the Department of Homeland Security issued its own alert, warning of a heightened risk of terrorist attacks during the upcoming holiday season.

    In related news, authorities in California have arrested several suspects believed to be connected to the terrorist group responsible for the planned attack. The suspects, whose names have not been released, are currently being interrogated by FBI agents in an effort to gather critical intelligence and potentially prevent the impending attack.

    "We are hopeful that our efforts will yield valuable information that will help us thwart this threat," said Jenkins. "However, we cannot discount the possibility that the attack could still occur, and we urge all Americans to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to local law enforcement."

    The FBI has asked citizens to be on the lookout for individuals exhibiting signs of radicalization, including increased religious devotion, isolation from family and friends, and support for violent extremist ideologies.

    "If you see something, say something," said Jenkins. "Your vigilance could save countless lives."
