In a shocking turn of events, a federal investigation has uncovered massive corruption within the Biden administration.
    
    The investigation, led by special counsel Reese Hayes, discovered a web of corruption that reached all the way to the top of the administration.
    
    According to sources close to the investigation, Joe Biden himself was found to be directly involved in numerous illegal activities.
    
    One such activity included the selling of political favors to wealthy donors and corporations in exchange for personal gain.
    
    "We've never seen anything like this before," said Hayes. "The level of corruption within this administration is truly staggering."
    
    As part of the investigation, authorities seized numerous documents detailing the illegal activities.
    
    One such document, dated January 2023, outlined a plan by Biden and his cronies to rig the upcoming presidential election in their favor.
    
    The plan involved using the power of the executive branch to influence voter turnout, manipulate voting machines, and even tamper with election results.
    
    "This is a blatant abuse of power," said Hayes. "We cannot allow such corruption to go unpunished."
    
    When asked about the allegations, Biden's press secretary, Rowan Roe, dismissed them as "fake news" and insisted that the president was innocent of any wrongdoing.
    
    However, sources close to the investigation say that Roe herself was also implicated in the corruption scandal.
    
    In addition to the federal investigation, several state-level probes have also been launched to determine if similar corruption occurred within local governments.
    
    As the scandal continues to unfold, many are left wondering how far the corruption extends and who else may be involved.
    
    One thing is for certain: the Biden administration is facing its most serious challenge yet, and the future of American democracy hangs in the balance.
