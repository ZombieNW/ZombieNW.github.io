In a shocking turn of events, the FBI has uncovered massive corruption within the Biden administration.
    The investigation, codenamed "Operation Clean Slate," began after a series of anonymous tips were received by the FBI.
    The findings have led to the arrest of several high-ranking officials, including Secretary of State Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Chief of Staff Ayanna Pressley.
    
    The scandal began when it was discovered that millions of taxpayer dollars had been funneled into private accounts belonging to Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden.
    Further investigation revealed that these funds were then used to bribe foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, in exchange for favorable trade deals.
    
    In a statement issued by the White House, President Biden claimed that he was unaware of any wrongdoing and vowed to cooperate fully with the FBI.
    However, sources close to the administration say that Biden has already begun searching for a replacement Vice President, with former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick being considered as a potential candidate.
    
    This latest scandal comes just months after the resignation of former Attorney General Elizabeth Warren over her involvement in a separate corruption case.
    Many political experts are now speculating whether the Biden administration can survive these repeated blows to its integrity.
    
    As the investigation continues, Americans are left wondering whether the corruption extends beyond the highest levels of government or if it trickles down to lower-ranking officials as well.
    One thing is for certain: the future of the Biden administration hangs in the balance as the nation awaits further developments from the FBI.
