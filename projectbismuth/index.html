            <h3>Welcome to Project Bismuth.<br>This game is a multiplayer game with a lobby system. There's not a whole lot to say about it, it was a project I made for my friends and I to play on. So I guess I'll list some features? Nice crosshair that changes color and has a hitmarker. 2 Maps with a lot of post processing. Mediocre at best maps. 3 Guns, 1 pistol, 1 sniper, and 1 rifle, and uhh the rifle is automatic. There is regen so you don't have to worry about permanent health loss, but you respawn in a random spot anyways so it's fine. I personally think the muzzle flash animation is cool but i stole the texture so sorry person who made that I don't know who you are. The game has some trees that look pretty nice, made by Kenney. Thanks Kenney. I also wanna thanks Toocan and Graham for helping me test this. I'm tired, it's currently midnight and I got to bed at like 2am yesterday. I'm also kind of hungry too, i should go get a sandwhich vbrb</h3>
