        <h1>Lost & Found</h1>
        <p>No this website isn't pretty, it's for the people who want to find info on old things.</p>
        <h3>I've made an archive available of the old ZombieNW website at <a href="https://archive.zombienw.com/">The ZombieNW.com Archive</a>.</h3>

        <h2>ZNW Bot</h2>
        <p>ZNW Bot has been long since discontinued due to the hosting company we used shutting down and unable to find one on our budget. It's updated source code before it's death is available on <a href="https://github.com/ZombieNW/ZNW-Bot">Github</a>.</p>

        <h2>Show Pages</h2>
        <p>I don't have any individual pages on shows yet until they're done, but... none of them are done... so just watch what you can at <a href="https://stream.zombienw.com">StreamNW</a>.</p>

        <h2>R0llin</h2>
        <p>How do you even remember it's existance? It's on the archive same place it was before.</p>
